# Linear Algebra in C

Procedurally generated C library for Linear Algebra in 2D/3D Computer Graphics (equivalent of [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm)). The goals are:
- consistent naming scheme of the functions/types/macros,
- human-readable source code despite being procedurally generated,
- minimal amount of dependencies,

## Quick Start

Grab [la.h](./la.h) and use it as an stb-style header-only library. For more info on such libraries see: https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/docs/stb_howto.txt

For a usage example see [./examples/ball.c](./examples/ball.c)

## Regenerating la.h

```console
$ cc -o nob nob.c
$ ./nob
```
